# Reflection

The goal of a reflection is to improve.

One does so writing down how a passed day went:
what did yo do, how did it go and how can it be improved?

By forcing oneself to think of this, one can actually learn from the past.

## What did you do?
First i got to type what i think the goal of prao is and who i think achived the goals. then i got to give feedback to 3 diffrent course materials, and lastly i got to try and find a code that would work.

## What did you do well?

I would say the thing i did the best was giving feedback to the course materials. I feel really proud of myself that i gave that good feedback. 

## What could be improved?
When i get a project that i need to google for the answers, i should think of better things to google.  When i say that i mean like i should think about what i want to get out of my search and think with logic what will come when i search this, will i get the answer that i'm looking for?

## What did your supervisor do well?
He made me feel welcomed. One thing that i really think was good is that he asked us questions that made us talk. Questions that we know the answer to, like.  "what are your hobbies"

## How can your supervisor be improved?
That is a great question, i don't really have anything to say. Yeah i don't know what to say.🙂

## What would you do differently next time?
First of all i would try to be on time although i had a good reason i still feel like i should have been on time. 
## Which tip would you give to future PRAO students?
Do your best! Don't give up, it might be hard at first but it gets better. Just belive in yourself and you will make it!
