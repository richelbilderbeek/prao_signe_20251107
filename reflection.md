# Reflection

The goal of a reflection is to improve.

One does so writing down how a passed day went:
what did yo do, how did it go and how can it be improved?

By forcing oneself to think of this, one can actually learn from the past.

## What did you do?


## What did you do well?



## What could be improved?


## What did your supervisor do well?


## How can your supervisor be improved?


## What would you do differently next time?


## Which tip would you give to future PRAO students?
