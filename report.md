project 1: PRAOs
The goal with prao is to prepair us for the adult world, we get to try how it is to work. We get to learn more stuff that we normally don't learn in school at all, but the most important thing is that we get to experience how it is to be in the work force. I have had 4 or well now 5 diffrent prao supervisors, i would say that everyone achieved the goal of prao. But the person i would say that achieved the goal of prao the best is Jerker. First of all we got to experience how it is to work in the data hall, we got to remove stuff and fix stuff. We learnt allot about the data hall that i other wise would never had even thought about! I would say that everyone did a equally good. 

project 2: feedback
For each course material i would like to see a summary, that in the course material it says what you will be learning. I would like if there were some questions that can prepair you for what's comming. I would also like some images that shows how to do some steps or to make the the course material more intresting to read about. Looking at images is also a way to get a quick glance of what the course material is about. And of course i want there to be some information about what you will be learning.
Documentation : The course material looks interesting and it does make me want to take the course. I like how in the begining it shows what you will be learning in the course and with the summary at the end it makes it clear what you will be learning. It does have some group questions that you are going to do, but not questions that you can take or try to solve before you start the course. And the course dosn't have any images, which is okay but it does make the course material look pretty bland and not very interesting to look at.
Package : It has a learning outcome that tells what students will be learning, and it has questions about the material, and where to find the answers. And if you are still not sure if you did correct it has answer button that shows you if you got it correct. It does also have a image, but it's not that clear of what it is about. It has no text that's conected to the picture, the only thing that can be conected is the word "Why?" So that's a little confusing. And there wasn't that much information about anything really. The whole course material is almost only exercises, no text or imformation at all. It does have some webpages with the information and that's good but i really would like for the course material to have more information. 
Refactoring and Modular programming : I like how it has a learning outcome for both part's of the programs, one for refactoring and one for modular programming. It dosn't have a summary, which is one of the most iportant things. It does have images that are clear what they are about. They have a text that very clearly explains what the picture is about. It does also have some exercises with the answers. But i dosn't have a summary.
project 3
I have serched on google, been to diffrent websites but i havn't found anything that could help me find a code that is working. So when i found codes i would test them out to see if they worked and everytime it didn't work. I have also asked Ai but it also didn't help me. Next time i get a projeckt like this one i will probaly do it a little diffrently.
