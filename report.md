The goal with prao is to prepair us for the adult world, we get to try how it is to work. We get to learn more stuff that we normally don't learn in school at all, but the most important thing is that we get to experience how it is to be in the work force. I have had 4 or well now 5 diffrent prao supervisors, i would say that everyone achieved the goal of prao. But the person i would say that achieved the goal of prao the best is Jerker. First of all we got to experience how it is to work in the data hall, we got to remove stuff and fix stuff. We learnt allot about the data hall that i other wise would never had even thought about! I would say that everyone did a equally good.
