# Reflection from supervisor

## What I did well

I think I treated Johannes and his other PRAO equally.
They were given actual jobs and I used their output directly.
I let them both know that I used their works.
I am happy about the last project: none have finished it, but it
does make one feel how it is to work at my workplace. 

## What I could do better

The start of the day was a bit sloppy:
one PRAO was late without a good reason
and the other was late with a good reason.
This means I had to badly introduce myself
to the first PRAO, until I would do this
properly with both of them present.
I need to think more about how to deal with two PRAOs
arriving at different times.

## My conclusion about my PRAO

Signe did a good job:

- she is focused
- she is polite
- she is mild/diplomatic:
  in the second assignment, rating course material,
  she did not choose a winner and instead rated them
  equally good
- she communicated well: she asked for input
  on how to handle the harder/third assignment

What could be even better:

- No idea :-)

All in all, I would certainly recommend having Signe as a PRAO!
